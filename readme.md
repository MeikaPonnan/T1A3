### Code style guide
Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.


### Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

### Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 

### Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application

Installed:
colored package - pip3 install colored
yahoo finance - pip3 install yahoofinace
pips3 freeze > requirements.txt 
        ./run.sh
pip3 install stock-webscraper
pip3 install pandas

### Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application
