### Planning:
I used monday.com to track my implementation plan.
I worked on each feature until i got the code to run smoothly. This took a while since i got stuck when creating multiple files.
Below is a screenshot of my implementation plan.

### How to install the application:


Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
- how to use any command line arguments made for the application

colored package - pip3 install colored
yahoo finance - pip3 install yahoofinace
pips3 freeze > requirements.txt 
        ./run.sh

### Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application
